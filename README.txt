README file:

The following project was created as per the requirements on the UDACITY Full Stack Developer project description. Using Python, I created multiple instances of the class movie in the corresponding driver file, entertainment_center.py, and then fed that list of data into a function named open_movies_page(list argument), which belongs to the fresh_tomatoes.py class. 

The function compiles the data and formats it into an .HTML page that is run on the local browser. The design of the website is done using CSS and HTML, which is already provided by the UDACITY team. I, however, made some specifications to mess around with the design. 

Let me know if you have further questions regarding running this project!
